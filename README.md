**Project Topic**
MAP estimate for an airport surveillance system

**Project Objectives**

-Determination of posterior probability density function (pdf) for the unobserved measurements
-Computation of MAP estimate and Mean square error estimate 


**Project Result**
Range measurements of an aircraft were determined by the radar using the MAP and MSE estimate method
